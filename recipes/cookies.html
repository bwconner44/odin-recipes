    <h2>Soft and Fluffy Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
        <p>This recipe produces <strong>the best</strong> chocolate chip cookies.  This recipe comes from years of my wife playing around with recipes.  She would make a batch and change one thing at a time until she got it perfect.  And, when I say perfect, I mean <em>PERFECT!</em></p>
        <P>This recipe is a staple in our house.  We do not even buy any type of cookies at the store any more because we would rather induldge in these freshly baked cookies.  Enjoy!</P>
