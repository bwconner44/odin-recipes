        <h2>Thick and Spicy Chili</h2>
            <p>This recipe is a family secret from my mother.  She used to make this for my dad when I was growing up.  I never ate it growing up because it was too spicy for me.  As I got older and began expanding my palate, I began liking more and more spicy dishes.  I eventually asked my mother for the recipe one year in college.  I have made it multiple times every fall.</p>
            <p>This recipe produces a very thick recipe.  The recipe states that, when the chili is finished cooking, a spoon should be able to stand staright up.  This is the way that I like my chili.  It is more stew like than soup like.  This recipe also is jammed packed of spices.  The spices build is fairly simple and common, but there is a heavy amount of chili pepper and red pepper.  The amount listed is the amount that is comfortable for me to eat without feeling like I am sweating as much as I do after a marathon.  The spice build can be adjusted up or down depending on your heat tolerance.</p>
